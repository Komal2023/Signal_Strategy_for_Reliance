Sell Signal: Triggered when the long-term SMA (e.g., 50-day) rises above the current price, suggesting a potential downward trend.Strategy Logic: I implemented a moving average-based strategy using Simple Moving Averages (SMA):
Tech Stack:
Python Libraries: pandas, numpy for data handling and analysis
Visualization: matplotlib for plotting trade signals
Formatting & Reporting: tabulate for clean, tabular output
